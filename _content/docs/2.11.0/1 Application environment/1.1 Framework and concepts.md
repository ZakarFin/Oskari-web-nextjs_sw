# 1.1 Framework and concepts

Oskari is a framework for easily building multipurpose web mapping applications utilizing distributed Spatial Data Infrastructures like INSPIRE. Oskari includes a frontend, a backend and in the future also a service bus. The user interface is implemented in JavaScript and the server functionality in Java. Oskari enables controlled extensibility. The service platform is kept flexible: functionality can be added both to the user interface and the server, and the application libraries can be changed.

The picture below shows the components of Oskari.

Application = starting one or more bundles.
Feature = not used anymore, functions
Bundle = a component in Oskari application. A selection of Oskari classes which form a component that offers additional functionality for an application. A bundle can offer multiple implementations for a functionality which can then be divided into smaller packages for different application setups. Packages can be used to offer a multiple views for the same functionality for example search functionality as a small on-map textfield or a window-like UI (see Tile/Flyout) for the same functionality.

Class = 
Plugin = bundles can contain plugins.
Module = Modules are components that can be registered to Oskari. Registering allows these components to for example send requests and receive events. Registering a module also calls the module init method. Usually modules start listening to events and register request handlers on start methods. stop method is called when the module is stopped but they usually aren't stopped.
