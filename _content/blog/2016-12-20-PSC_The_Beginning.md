## Introduction to Oskari OSGeo progress

- Jani Kylmäaho presented the background for arranging the meeting and stated that it is
time to give Oskari.org software to the community to foster. Nevertheless, National
Land Survey of Finland will continue to be actively participating in the development and
collaboration activities also in the future.
- Sanna Jokela presented the <a href="/files/20161220-Oskari_OSGEO_PSC.pdf" target="_blank">themes behind the Oskari development and OSGeo
processes</a>. To become part of OSGeo brings open source geospatial projects stability
and international visibility. Certain requirements have to be fulfilled, one being the
establishment of Project Steering Committee (PSC) for Oskari.
- Sanna Jokela introduced the drafts for Community Roles, PSC tasks & rules and Oskari
Roadmap. These documents were discussed.

### Comments for Oskari Community Roles:

- [Link to Github wiki](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari.org/wiki/Roles-of-Oskari-Community)
- Coordinator should be added to the list and describe how community events
and activation methods are to be conducted

### Comments for Project Steering Committee (PSC) tasks, roles and rules:

- [Link to Github wiki](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari.org/wiki/Project-Steering-Committee)
- Just to clarify:
1. The membership of the PSC is stable, unless the member wants to
step down or is voted to step down (e.g. due to inactivity)
2. Members are individuals, not organisational representatives
3. Members can be added afterwards or invited to the group by the PSC
- Communication methods should be open - everybody should see the
suggested features and votes given to these. Email is not the only discussion
forum for the issues and private email list should not be created for the PSC.
This will be added to the rules.
- Voting should be possible with any digital method proven suitable for the group
(e.g email, slack, github). This will be added to the rules.

### Oskari Roadmap
- [Link to Github wiki](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari.org/wiki/Oskari-Improvement-Proposals-and-Roadmap)
- This is a draft and needs to be refined by the PSC in their first meeting

## Establishing Oskari PSC

nominated were elected as members of the PSC:
	- Jussi Arpalahti
	- Marko Kauppi
	- Jaakko Ruutiainen
	- Tuuli Pihlajamaa
	- Hafliði Sigtryggur Magnússon
	- Sami Mäkinen
	- Timo Sallinen
	- Tomi Lukkarinen

- Election of the chair: Sami Mäkinen was suggested to be the chair and was elected for the chair. Decision was unanimous.
- Establishing the rules: The rules were established with minor corrections. They can be further revised by the PSC if needed.

##  Next steps

First Oskari PSC meeting: The Chair will suggest the PSCs first meeting on January 2017. Refining the Roadmap is the first priority of the PSC.
