## Development process

Quick review of the updated documents:

- [http://oskari.org/documentation/development/how-to-contribute](http://oskari.org/documentation/development/how-to-contribute)
- [http://oskari.org/documentation/development/issuetypes](http://oskari.org/documentation/development/issuetypes)
- [http://oskari.org/documentation/development/guidelines](http://oskari.org/documentation/development/guidelines)
- [http://oskari.org/documentation/development/oskari-git-process](http://oskari.org/documentation/development/oskari-git-process)
- [http://oskari.org/documentation/development/review](http://oskari.org/documentation/development/review)

The review part is mostly copied from the GeoServer project. It will
evolve once we gain more experience on the subject.

It was noted that we need to be clear how to handle backwards incompatible changes.
We need to have documentation about this on oskari.org.

For the frontend the "public" API that should remain compatible or any changes need to
be documented are:

- functions in the Oskari global variable
- functions for the bundle/module lifecycle spec (start/stop etc)

For bundles:

- requests
- events
- services
- configuration
- state

For backend at least:

- action route parameters
- action route responses

## Oskari Improvement Proposal (OIP)

An OIP is needed when some fundamental functionality changes.
An OIP is not needed for new functionality or functionality built on existing code.

Examples for OIPs:

- Migrating the geoportal views to Openlayers 3 (there could be geoportals with custom code that will break)
- Maplayers can be grouped, but a layer can only belong to one group. A change that will enable layers to belong to multiple groups requires an OIP as it changes the way layers are loaded to frontend and will break existing functionality if not patched.

Examples not requiring OIP:

- new bundle (frontend)
- Adding Openlayers 3 support for bundles (frontend)
- new action route (server)
- new search channel (server)

## Roadmap

All current roadmap items in GitHub was reviewed and accepted.

A new label was added: "proposal".
All new roadmap items will be first tagged with the proposal label in addition
 to roadmap label. Once the item is accepted the proposal label is removed.
This means that the official roadmap is issues with only the roadmap label.

## Waffle.io/GitHub projects

It was agreed that currently we don't really need either.

The decision to use additional tools for managing issues was postponed.
Once we have a proper use case and need for additional tools we can continue the discussion.

## Other topics

We should have some responsible and well defined way to deal with and communicate about possible security issues/vulnerabilities. Also possibility to report security issues in a way that is not completely public.
