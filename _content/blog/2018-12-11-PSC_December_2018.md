## Last meeting topics and follow-up

Download basket: updates & requests for downloading under research

Turku University of Applied Science students have made usability research on Oskari (Suomi.fi maps, Paikkatietoikkuna / Statistics Finland needs and Oskari.org documentation). Documentation from the projects have been sent to the responsible parties, Sanna can do a summary of them in English. 

Discussion about when to take new Oskari version in use and instructions for updating community bundles. LTR-thinking needs funding - who is responsible? New release is updated always in Paikkatietoikkuna, Elf & ArcticSDI, but e.g. Tampere has still a year old version. Documentation / instructions: newest release is always the best (Sanna willl add this to the community-pages)
