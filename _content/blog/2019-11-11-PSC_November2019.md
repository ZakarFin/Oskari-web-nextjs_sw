## Last meeting topics and follow-up

- Oskari Rintamäki a new PSC member
- FOSS4G 2019 news and news from the members
- 1.53 coming up (now released), 1.54 coming soon:
- new layer list coming, release maybe next week, check the new layer list functionality from: https://demo-kartta.paikkatietoikkuna.fi/. It started from Admin side improvements, but it was decided to go ahead first with combining the layer list and selected layers. If somebody wants to add hierarchy to the layers, they could develop this further. Also if old hierarchical layer functionality needs the admin side functions, they could attach the new admin tools to the existing layer listing. 
Mobile tracking improvement coming up, now new possibilities for showing location of users in published maps
- Deprecated transport code still available, but not tested
- New WFS backend, strong recommendation to use the new one

## 3D needs

3D needs was discussed and no acute needs for 3D showed up by the members of PSC. 3D needs should be further discussed with Oskari users.

Cesium provides the 3D possiblities in Oskari and thus it can do things supported in Cesium. 

Own 3D datasets could be a possibility to add to the tool. 

3D module is coming to the next release. 

## WFS backend tests
