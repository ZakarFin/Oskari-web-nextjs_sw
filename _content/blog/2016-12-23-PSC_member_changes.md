# OSGeo PSC first actions

Closely following the initial PSC election a new individual informed of his interest to join the PSC.

A quick vote was arranged in Slack for adding a new member:
Marko Kuosmanen has been working on the core Oskari team for a few years already and the vote was unanimously for him joining the PSC.

The current steering committee is:

- Jussi Arpalahti
- Marko Kauppi
- Jaakko Ruutiainen
- Tuuli Pihlajamaa
- Hafliði Sigtryggur Magnússon
- Sami Mäkinen
- Timo Sallinen
- Tomi Lukkarinen
- Heikki Ylitalo
- Marko Kuosmanen

## Next steps

The first actual meeting is at the end of January 2017. Roadmap issues and other topics for discussion are being gathered. If you want to raise an issue for the roadmap to be discussed on the meeting, you should do it by 16.1.2017. Instructions to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari.org/wiki/Roadmap-process).
