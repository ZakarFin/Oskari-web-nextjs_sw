        <h2>Project steering committee</h2>
        <Text>
          Oskari Project Steering Committee (PSC) is responsible for updating
          Oskari Roadmap and discusses the technical issues around Oskari.org in
          order to ensure consistent maintenance of the software. When new
          proposals are added to the Roadmap, the PSC members are informed and
          discussion on the suggested features should be active. Committing the
          feature is approved by the Project Steering Committee. Trusted
          developers can also be granted commit rights to the repository.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Oskari PSC will be compiled from active contributors, Oskari Community
          Members and Project owners. Anybody interested in working in Oskari
          PSC can become a member (see Adding members).Oskari PSC is a steering
          group, a not a management group. This means that the PSC’s job is to
          describe and decide which new features are adopted to Oskari.org
          repository. The implementation of these features are done by Community
          members or Project owner organizations in their projects. Oskari PSC
          also advises in issues related to Oskari development. The rules for
          Oskari PSC are adopted from GeoServer, GeoNode & other OSGeo projects.
